### Maintenance and Inspection

Regular maintenance and inspection of your fire extinguisher are imperative to ensure it's always ready to use in case of an emergency.

## FAQ


### Why do I need a fire extinguisher?

A fire extinguisher is a safety device that allows you to quickly extinguish small-scale fires before they can spread, causing more damage to property or harm to people.

Knowing how to use a fire extinguisher effectively is also a vital lifeskill that could prove invaluable in the event of a fire emergency.

It is necessary to understand these classifications and choose a fire extinguisher appropriate for your fire risks. 

The type of fire extinguisher you need can be determined by a combination of factors such as what you are trying to put out the fire from, the location, and the surrounding conditions.
