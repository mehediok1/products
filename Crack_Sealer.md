## FAQ


### What is a crack sealer?

A crack sealer is a type of construction material designed to fill and seal cracks, crevices, and joints in surfaces such as concrete, asphalt, and masonry. It helps to prevent water and other elements from penetrating and causing further damage to the structure. Crack sealers come in various forms, including liquids, pastes, and rubberized compounds, and are typically applied using a caulking gun or other special tool. 

Some common applications for crack sealers include sealing cracks in driveways, parking lots, sidewalks, patios, and foundation walls. They are also used in construction projects to seal joints in walls and floors, as well as to fill gaps and voids in various types of building materials. Crack sealers can help prolong the life of these structures by preventing water intrusion and reducing the risk of mold, mildew, and other types of water damage. 


### What are the benefits of using a crack sealer?

Using a crack sealer offers several benefits, including: 
1) Prevention of water damage: Crack sealers help prevent water from entering and damaging the structure, reducing the risk of mold, mildew, and other types of water damage. 2) Improved appearance: Filling cracks and joints with a crack sealer creates a smoother, more uniform surface, which can enhance the visual appeal of the structure. 3) Increased durability: A well-sealed surface is less likely to crack or break over time, providing increased durability and reducing the need for costly repairs. 4) Cost-effective: Crack sealers are generally an affordable solution compared to the cost of major repairs or replacements, making them a cost-effective choice for maintaining the integrity of a structure. 

Regular maintenance, including the use of crack sealers, can help extend the lifespan of structures and save money in the long run. It is essential to address cracks and gaps promptly to prevent further deterioration and the need for more extensive repairs or replacement. Applying a crack sealer should be considered as part of a routine maintenance program for any structure made of concrete, asphalt, or masonry. 


### How long does a crack sealer last?

The lifespan of a crack sealer depends on several factors, including the type of sealer used, the environmental conditions in which it is applied, and the traffic or load-bearing requirements of the surface. Generally, crack sealers can last from several months to several years, depending on these factors. To ensure the longest possible lifespan, it is essential to choose a high-quality crack sealer and follow the manufacturer's application guidelines. 

It is also important to perform regular inspections of the sealed surfaces to identify any new cracks or potential issues that may require repairs. Regular maintenance, including the reapplication of crack sealers as needed, can help maximize their lifespan and ensure the continued effectiveness of the sealing process. 


### What types of crack sealers are available?

There are several types of crack sealers available on the market, including: 
1) Liquid sealers: These are typically water-based or solvent-based products that are applied using a caulking gun or other hand tool. They can be used on a variety of surfaces, including concrete and masonry, and are suitable for both indoor and outdoor applications. 2) Paste sealers: These are thicker, more viscous products that are often used for joints and seams in floors, walls, and other structures. They may require specialized tools for application and are typically suitable for indoor applications. 

3) Rubberized sealers: These products contain a high amount of rubber or plastic particles that help create a flexible, durable seal. They are suitable for use on both indoor and outdoor surfaces and are often chosen for their durability and resistance to ultraviolet (UV) light and other environmental factors. It is essential to choose the right type of crack sealer based on the specific needs of the project and the requirements of the surface being sealed. 


### How do I apply a crack sealer?

Applying a crack sealer typically involves the following steps: 
1) Clean and prepare the area: Remove any loose debris, dirt, or oil from the cracked surface. Use a wire brush, steel wool, or other suitable tool to clean the area and create a smooth, even surface. 2) Apply the sealer: Use a caulking gun or other special tool to apply the crack sealer to the prepared area. Apply a bead of sealer of the appropriate width, ensuring that it fills the cracks and gaps completely. 3) Finish and cure: Use a trowel or putty knife to smooth out the sealer, creating a uniform surface. Allow the sealer to cure according to the manufacturer's instructions, typically between 24 hours and several days, depending on the type of sealer and environmental conditions. 

It is essential to follow the manufacturer's application guidelines carefully to ensure proper installation and the best performance of the crack sealer. Additionally, it is crucial to inspect the sealed surface regularly to identify any new cracks or potential issues that may require additional maintenance or repairs. 


### Can I use a crack sealer on my driveway or parking lot?

Yes, crack sealers can be used on driveways and parking lots to help maintain their appearance and structural integrity. Cracks and gaps in asphalt or concrete surfaces can allow water and debris to penetrate, leading to deterioration and the need for costly repairs. By filling these cracks with a suitable crack sealer, you can help prevent further damage and extend the life of the surface. 

It is essential to choose a high-quality crack sealer specifically designed for use on driveways and parking lots, as these products may need to withstand heavy traffic and environmental factors such as UV light, salt, and oil.

Regular maintenance, including the reapplication of crack sealers as needed, can help maintain the overall condition of your driveway or parking lot and save you money in the long run.
